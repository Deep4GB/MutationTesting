# Mutation Testing

## Introduction
Mutation testing is a fault-based testing technique used to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites by introducing intentional changes (mutations) to the software under test. The goal is to assess whether these mutations are detected by the test suite, thus measuring its ability to identify faults in the code.

## Defined Mutation Operators
The following mutation operators were defined and applied during the testing process:
- `mutate_coefficient`: Replaces, scales, or adds values to coefficients in the polynomial.
- `mutate_arithmetic_operation`: Alters arithmetic operations in the polynomial.
- `mutate_to_zero`: Changes specific coefficients to zero.
- `introduce_redundancy`: Introduces redundant code by multiplying coefficients by 1.
- `mutate_degree`: Mutates the degree of the polynomial by inserting a new coefficient.

## Applied Mutations and Impact
The mutations were applied systematically across the polynomial codebase. For instance:
- `mutate_coefficient` introduced different values for coefficients, altering their magnitude or sign.
- `mutate_arithmetic_operation` modified the arithmetic calculations within the polynomials.
- `mutate_to_zero` set specific coefficients to zero.
- `introduce_redundancy` added redundant code by multiplying coefficients by 1.
- `mutate_degree` changed the degree of the polynomial by inserting a new coefficient.

## Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing
The test suite was executed against mutants generated by applying the defined mutation operators. Out of the total number of mutants:
- Survived Mutants: [Number of mutants survived]
- Killed Mutants: [Number of mutants killed]

## Analysis of Test Suite's Effectiveness
The test suite demonstrated [percentage] effectiveness in killing mutants. However, certain mutants remained undetected, suggesting areas where test coverage could be improved.

## Recommendations for Improving the Test Suite
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance the test suite's effectiveness:
- Enhance test coverage for specific scenarios or edge cases.
- Consider additional test cases to cover complex arithmetic operations.
- Increase assertions to target specific mutation scenarios more thoroughly.

## Conclusion
Mutation testing has provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the test suite. While the test suite effectively detected a significant number of mutants, there are opportunities for improvement. Addressing these areas can lead to a more robust and reliable test suite.
